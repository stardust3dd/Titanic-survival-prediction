# Titanic-survival-prediction

This kernel obtained a score of 0.78947 & a rank of 3197/13482 on our first submission.

We used stratified 10-fold cross validation to test the accuracy scores of our models.
Random forest with a 1000 trees performed the best on our training data. We implement
the same on out testing data. 

In future versions, I will try to implement stacked models to further improve our accuracy.

Please feel free to point out mistakes in the kernel, if any.
